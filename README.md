# Project Overview

This C# project is a cumulative assignment showcasing the implementation of **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete)** operations. It focuses on managing teacher data in an educational context while following object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

## Key Features

- **Teacher Class**:  
  Includes properties such as:  
  - `T_Id`  
  - `FName`  
  - `LName`  
  - `HireDate`  
  - `E_Number`  
  - `Salary`  

- **Data Management**:  
  Simplifies storing, retrieving, and managing teacher information efficiently.  

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:  
  - Uses encapsulation with getters and setters.  
  - Ensures clean, maintainable, and secure code.  

## Usability

This project is ideal for educational and developmental purposes. It is designed for:

- **Educational Institutions**:  
  To manage teacher data effectively.  

- **Developers**:  
  To explore CRUD operations and OOP concepts in a real-world application.  

## What You Can Do

- **Perform CRUD Operations**:  
  Manage teacher details such as:  
  - Unique identification numbers (`TeacherId`)  
  - Names (`TeacherFName` and `TeacherLName`)  
  - Hire dates (`TeacherHireDate`)  
  - Employee numbers (`EmployeeNumber`)  
  - Salary details (`TeacherSalary`)  

- **Learn OOP Principles**:  
  Gain hands-on experience with:  
  - Encapsulation  
  - Property management  
  - Class design  

## Who Is It For?

- **New Developers**:  
  A simple and clear project for understanding C# fundamentals.  

- **Students**:  
  A great resource for studying OOP and CRUD concepts with practical examples.  

This project is a practical learning tool that demonstrates how to implement CRUD operations and OOP principles in a C# application.
