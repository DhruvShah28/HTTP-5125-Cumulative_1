# School Database Project: Managing Teachers, Students, and Courses

This project demonstrates how to build *CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)* operations using *ASP.NET Core Web API and MVC*. It focuses on managing data for teachers, students, and courses within a school database. The main goal is to create a basic working version, called a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), that allows users to manage data through both API endpoints and web pages.

## Features

The application enables users to add, view, update, and delete information for teachers, students, and courses. It ensures data validity by checking for issues like incorrect dates, missing information, or duplicate records. The data is stored in a *MySQL database*, with well-defined relationships between teachers, students, and courses to keep the information organized and consistent.

## Testing

Testing is a key part of the project. Each CRUD operation is thoroughly checked to ensure it functions correctly. This includes verifying that new records are added properly, data can be retrieved accurately, and records are deleted without errors. Screenshots and *cURL* commands are provided to demonstrate successful testing.

## Purpose

This project is useful for schools or developers who want to manage academic data or learn about web development. It provides a hands-on opportunity to understand how websites interact with databases and how to write clean, well-structured code.

## Learning Objectives

1. *Master CRUD Operations*: Implement full Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality for teachers, students, and courses.
2. *Practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)*: Apply OOP concepts like using classes, properties, and methods for scalable code.
3. *Database Integration*: Learn how to connect data using a relational database, ensuring proper relationships between tables.
4. *Data Consistency*: Ensure data integrity by linking courses and teachers using database keys.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- *ASP.NET Core SDK*
- *MySQL Server*
- *Entity Framework Core*
- *cURL* or *SwaggerUI* (for API testing)
